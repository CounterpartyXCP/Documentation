## Read API Function Reference


### get_{table}

**get_{table}(filters=[], filterop='AND', order_by=null, order_dir=null, start_block=null, end_block=null, status=null, limit=1000, offset=0, show_expired=true)**

Where **{table}** must be one of the following values:
``assets``, ``balances``, ``bets``, ``bet_expirations``, ``bet_matches``, ``bet_match_expirations``, ``bet_match_resolutions``, ``broadcasts``, ``btcpays``, ``burns``, ``cancels``, ``credits``, ``debits``,  ``dividends``, ``issuances``, ``mempool``, ``orders``, ``order_expirations``, ``order_matches``, ``order_match_expirations``, or ``sends``, ``dispensers``.

For example: ``get_balances``, ``get_credits``, ``get_debits`` are all valid API methods. A complete list of tables can be found in the api.py file in the counterparty-lib repository.

**Parameters:**

  * **filters** (*list/dict*): An optional filtering object, or list of filtering objects. See [filtering](#filtering-read-api-results) for more information.
  * **filterop** (*string*): Specifies how multiple filter settings are combined. Defaults to ``AND``, but ``OR`` can
    be specified as well. See [filtering](#filtering-read-api-results) for more information.
  * **order_by ** (*string*): If sorted results are desired, specify the name of an attribute of the appropriate table to
    order the results by (e.g. ``quantity`` for [balance object](#balance-object), if you called ``get_balances``).
    If left blank, the list of results will be returned unordered.
  * **order_dir** (*string*): The direction of the ordering. Either ``ASC`` for ascending order, or ``DESC`` for descending
    order. Must be set if ``order_by`` is specified. Leave blank if ``order_by`` is not specified.
  * **start_block** (*integer*): If specified, only results from the specified block index on will be returned
  * **end_block** (*integer*): If specified, only results up to and including the specified block index on will be returned
  * **status** (*string/list*): return only results with the specified status or statuses (if a list of status strings is supplied).
    See the [status list](#status). Note that if ``null`` is supplied (the default), then status is not filtered.
    Also note that status filtering can be done via the ``filters`` parameter, but doing it through this parameter is more
    flexible, as it essentially allows for situations where ``OR`` filter logic is desired, as well as status-based filtering.
  * **limit** (*integer*): (maximum) number of elements to return. Can specify a value less than or equal to the instance's max limit (default 1000).
    For more results, use a combination of ``limit`` and ``offset`` parameters to paginate results. If the instance has a limit of 0 you can specify
    any limit for the row results, even 0 to get the full dataset.
  * **offset** (*integer*): return results starting from specified ``offset``

**Special Parameters:**

  * **show_expired** (*boolean*): used only for ``get_orders``. When false, `get_orders` doesn't return orders which expire next block.
  * **memo_hex** (*string*): used only for ``get_sends``. When specified, filter the table for a hexadecimal value instead of searching by a text string.

**Special Results:**

  * **memo** (*string*): used only for ``get_sends``. The utf-8 encoded string of the memo (like ``for pizza``).  This value will be an empty string for hexadecimal-encoded memo IDs that are not valud UTF-8 strings.
  * **memo_hex** (*string*): used only for ``get_sends``. Returns the memo field expressed as a hexadecimal value (like ``666f722070697a7a61``).

**Return:**

  A list of objects with attributes corresponding to the queried table fields.

**Examples:**

  * To get a listing of bets, call ``get_bets``. This method will return a list of one or more [bet object](#bet-object) .
  * To get a listing all open orders for a given address like 1Ayw5aXXTnqYfS3LbguMCf9dxRqzbTVbjf, you could call
    ``get_orders`` with the appropriate parameters. This method will return a list of one or more order [object](#order-object).
  * To get all open "buy BTC" orders from the DEx, call ``get_orders`` and use the following filter: ``[{"field": "get_asset", "op": "==", "value": "BTC"}, {"field": "status", "op": "==", "value": "open"}]``.
  * To get all BTC pays (for DEx order matches) between the source 1Ayw5aXXTnqYfS3LbguMCf9dxRqzbTVbjf and destination (BTC buyer) 193SB3xgYjmfesdRqXq4g3eG9rD9DmWBSD, use `get_btcpays` method with these parameters: ``{ "filters": [{"field": "source", "op": "==", "value": "1Ayw5aXXTnqYfS3LbguMCf9dxRqzbTVbjf"}, {"field": "destination", "op": "==", "value": "193SB3xgYjmfesdRqXq4g3eG9rD9DmWBSD"}],"filterop": "and"}``

**Notes:**

  * Please note that the ``get_balances`` API call will not return balances for BTC itself. It only returns balances
    for XCP and other Counterparty assets. To get BTC-based balances, use an existing system such as Bitcoin Core, blockchain.info, etc.

    * FLAG_BINARY_MEMO: (*integer*) 4, specifies that the memo is in binary/hex form.
  * **memo** (*string, optional*): The [Memo](../../advanced/protocol#memos) associated with this transaction.
  * *NOTE: Additional (advanced) parameters for this call are documented [here](#advanced-create_-parameters).*

**Return:**

  The unsigned transaction, as an hex-encoded string. Must be signed before being broadcast: see [here](#signing-transactions-before-broadcasting) for more information.


### Advanced `create_` parameters

Each `create_` call detailed below can take the following common keyword parameters:

  * **encoding** (*string*): The encoding method to use, see [transaction encodings](#transaction-encodings) for more info.
  * **pubkey** (*string/list*): The hexadecimal public key of the source address (or a list of the keys, if multi‐sig). Required when using ``encoding`` parameter values of ``multisig`` or ``pubkeyhash``. See [transactions encoding](#transaction-encodings) for more info
  * **allow_unconfirmed_inputs** (*boolean*): Set to ``true`` to allow this transaction to utilize unconfirmed UTXOs as inputs. Defaults to `false`.
  * **fee** (*integer*): If you'd like to specify a custom miners' fee, specify it here (in satoshi). Leave as default for the server to automatically choose.
  * **fee_per_kb** (*integer*): The fee per kilobyte of transaction data constant that the server uses when deciding on the dynamic fee to use (in satoshi).
  * **fee_provided** (*integer*): If you would like to specify a maximum fee (up to and including which may be used as the transaction fee), specify it here (in satoshi). This differs from `fee` in that this is an upper bound value, which `fee` is an exact value.
  * **custom_inputs** (*list*): Use only these specific UTXOs as inputs for the transaction being created. If specified, this parameter is a list of (JSON-encoded) UTXO objects, whose properties match those as retrieved by `listunspent` function from bitcoind (e.g. see [here](https://chainquery.com/bitcoin-api/listunspent)). Note that the actual UTXOs used may be a subset of this list.
  * **unspent_tx_hash** (*string*): When compiling the UTXOs to use as inputs for the transaction being created, only consider unspent outputs from this specific transaction hash. Defaults to `null` to consider all UTXOs for the address. Do not use this parameter if you are specifying `custom_inputs`.
  * **regular_dust_size** (*integer*): Specify (in satoshi) to override the (dust) amount of BTC used for each non-(bare) multisig output. Defaults to `5430` satoshi.
  * **multisig_dust_size** (*integer*): Specify (in satoshi) to override the (dust) amount of BTC used for each (bare) multisig output. Defaults to `7800` satoshi.
  * **dust_return_pubkey** (*string*): The dust return pubkey is used in multi-sig data outputs (as the only real pubkey) to make those the outputs spendable. By default, this pubkey is taken from the pubkey used in the first transaction input. However, it can be overridden here (and is _required_ to be specified if a P2SH input is used and multisig is used as the data output encoding.) If specified, specify the public key (in hex format) where dust will be returned to so that it can be reclaimed. Only valid/useful when used with transactions that utilize multisig data encoding. Note that if this value is set to `false`, this instructs `counterparty-server` to use the default dust return pubkey configured at the node level. If this default is not set at the node level, the call will generate an exception.
  * **disable_utxo_locks** (*boolean*): By default, UTXO's utilized when creating a transaction are "locked" for a few seconds, to prevent a case where rapidly generating `create_` calls reuse UTXOs due to their spent status not being updated in bitcoind yet. Specify `true` for this parameter to disable this behavior, and not temporarily lock UTXOs.
  * **op_return_value** (*integer*): The value (in satoshis) to use with any `OP_RETURN` outputs in the generated transaction. Defaults to `0`. Don't use this, unless you like [throwing your money away](https://m.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2plfsv/what_happens_to_the_value_of_a_coin_locked_with/cmxrnhu).
  * **extended_tx_info** (*boolean*): When this is not specified or false, the `create_` calls return only a hex-encoded string.  If this is true, the `create_` calls return a data object with the following keys: `tx_hex`, `btc_in`, `btc_out`, `btc_change`, and `btc_fee`.
  * **p2sh_pretx_txid** (*string*): The previous transaction `txid` for a two part ``P2SH`` message. This `txid` must be taken from the signed transaction.

**With the exception of `pubkey` and `allow_unconfirmed_inputs`, these values should be left at their defaults, unless you know what you are doing.**

#### Transaction Encodings

By default the default value of the ``encoding`` parameter detailed above is ``auto``, which means that `counterparty-server` automatically determines the best way to encode the Counterparty protocol data into a new transaction. If you know what you are doing and would like to explicitly specify an encoding:

- To return the transaction as an **OP_RETURN** transaction, specify ``opreturn`` for the ``encoding`` parameter.
   - **OP_RETURN** transactions cannot have more than 80 bytes of data. If you force OP_RETURN encoding and your transaction would have more than this amount, an exception will be generated.
- To return the transaction as a **multisig** transaction, specify ``multisig`` for the ``encoding`` parameter.
    - ``pubkey`` should be set to the hex-encoded public key of the source address.
    - Note that with the newest versions of Bitcoin (0.12.1 onward), bare multisig encoding does not reliably propagate. More information on this is documented [here](https://github.com/rubensayshi/counterparty-lib/pull/9).
- To return the transaction as a **pubkeyhash** transaction, specify ``pubkeyhash`` for the ``encoding`` parameter.
    - ``pubkey`` should be set to the hex-encoded public key of the source address.
- To return the transaction as a 2 part **P2SH** transaction, specify ``P2SH`` for the encoding parameter.
    - First call the ``create_`` method with the ``encoding`` set to ``P2SH``.
    - Sign the transaction as usual and broadcast it. It's recommended but not required to wait the transaction to confirm as malleability is an issue here (P2SH isn't yet supported on segwit addresses).
    - The resulting ``txid`` must be passed again on an identic call to the ``create_`` method, but now passing an additional parameter ``p2sh_pretx_txid`` with the value of the previous transaction's id.
    - The resulting transaction is a ``P2SH`` encoded message, using the redeem script on the transaction inputs as data carrying mechanism.
    - Sign the transaction following the ``Bitcoinjs-lib on javascript, signing a P2SH redeeming transaction`` section
    - **NOTE**: Don't leave pretxs hanging without transmitting the second transaction as this pollutes the UTXO set and risks making bitcoin harder to run on low spec nodes.
