The Board of Directors shall have the power to: (a) Select and remove all officers, agents, employees and contractors, and to fix reasonable compensation therefor; (b) To authorize and empower officers or agents to enter into contracts and other commitments on behalf of the Corporation; (c) To appoint and delegate responsibilities and authority to committees, officers, and agents; and (d) To approve a fiscal year budget proposed by the Treasurer and Executive Committee.

##Section 5.2 Number of Directors:

The minimum authorized number of directors is five (5). The number of directors may be increased beyond this by resolution of two-thirds of the directors then in office.

##Section 5.3 Composition of Board of Directors Terms:

All directors serving on the Board of Directors shall be selected in the manner set forth in this Section 5.3.

(a) Directors: Members of the Corporation, voting as a class, shall elect five (5) Directors, during a once yearly two (2) week voting period. The following procedure shall be undertaken:
Within one week before voting period begins:
- Director candidate nominated. May self nominate, or be nominated by another individual. Each candidate must hold at least 50 XCP, which they will prove by signing a specific message (chosen by the Executive Director) with their private key. The sitting board of directors, by a super-majority vote, may disqualify non-viable candidates from election.
- At the start of the two week voting period: 
    - Current Executive Director (or other Executive Committee member of the Executive Director’s choosing) will generate a Bitcoin address for each Director candidate.
- During this two week voting period:
    - Owners of addresses with XCP balance may give their votes to one or more candidates by broadcasting a message with the following parameters: 1. text = XCPELECTION + YEAR + Candidate Number, 2. value = votes. The sum total of the values must be less than the XCP balance of the source address at the close of the voting period. A different text other than this may be used to avoid naming conflicts, and alternatively, the voting procedure detailed in CIP 005 may be used once implemented.
- Immediately after this two week voting period:
    - Current Executive Director will tally and report on the results of the voting. The top five (5) candidate address with the highest number of votes will be announced as the winners of the election, and will receive the Director positions for the term of one (1) year from the date of the end of the voting period.

(b) Observers: Each director shall have the right to designate a single observer to attend Board of Directors meetings when such director is unable to be present. However, the director shall provide prior notice to the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman approves the request. Such a request shall not be unreasonably denied. An observer attending in place of a director shall have the right to fully participate in the general session, but may not vote on or put forth any motion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Observer may vote by proxy if approved by the Board in advance.

(c) Terms and Election Dates: All directors shall hold office until their successor is elected. Except for adjustments that may be made by the Board from time-to-time to maintain or create staggered terms upon any increase or decrease in the authorized number of directors, the term of office for all Directors and At-Large Directors shall be one (1) year and shall run every May first (May 1) of the calendar year, with elections preceeding at least two (2) weeks before. Unless elected by written ballot pursuant to Section 4.9, the positions of directors then expiring shall be filled and elections held at the annual meeting of members called for such purpose. The Board of Directors may issue resolutions establishing procedures governing elections of directors, provided that those resolutions are consistent with these Bylaws and the Articles.


##Section 5.4 Vacancies:

Board of Directors vacancies shall be handled in the following ways:

(a) Vacancies resulting from the expiration of a director's term shall be filled by an election by the majority of a quorum of members.

(b) Vacancies of a Director resulting from resignation of the director or removal of the director shall be filled within 30 days by the runner-up with the highest voted XCP stake during the last held XCP stake voting procedure (as outlined in section 5.3(a)). If the selected runner-up is not interested in the seat, the runner-up with the next highest voted XCP stake shall be offered the seat, and so on, until an interested runner-up is identified. If there is no such interested runner-up or this process is otherwise inapplicable, a new XCP stake voting procedure shall be held to fill the vacant seat.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if these Bylaws are amended to expand the number of directors representing a membership class, the Board of Directors may appoint an interim director representing such class until the members of such class elect a director. Each director shall hold office until his or her successor is elected. A vacancy shall be deemed to exist in the following situations:

(a) Death, resignation, or removal of any director;

(b) An increase in the authorized number of directors without election of the additional directors so provided for;

(c) Failure to elect the full number of authorized directors;

(d) As provided in the last sentence of this Section 5.4. If the Board authorizes a reduction in the amount of directors, such a reduction shall not remove any director prior to the expiration or other termination of his or her term.

Regular Board of Directors meetings may be held without notice of the date, time, or purpose. At least two (2) days notice of the time and place of each meeting of the Board of Directors not fixed by an express provision of the Bylaws or by a standing Board of Directors resolution shall be given to each director by personal delivery, telephone, telegraph, facsimile, electronic mail, or first class mail.

##Section 5.9 Action Without Meeting:

Any Board of Directors action required or permitted to be taken by applicable law may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board individually or collectively consent in writing to such action. The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents that:

(a) Describe the action taken;

(b) Are signed by each director; and

(c) Are included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken.

Action taken in accordance with this section is effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the consent specifies an earlier or later effective date. Any consent signed hereunder has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document.

##Section 5.10 Meetings Held via Electronic Communications Technology:

The Board of Directors may permit any or all directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through, use of any means of communication by which all participating directors may simultaneously read or hear each substantially concurrently with their occurrence, vote on matters submitted to the members, pose questions, and make comments. A director participating in a meeting by this means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.

##Section 5.11 Quorum:

Unless otherwise provided herein, fifty-percent (50%) of the directors then in office (but in no case fewer than one-third (1/3) of the fixed or prescribed number of directors provided for in these Bylaws) shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except to adjourn. Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present shall be regarded as the act of the Board of Directors, unless a greater number is required by law, the Articles, or these Bylaws.

##Section 5.12 Fees and Compensation:

The Board of Directors, by resolution, may provide for compensation and reimbursement to directors and members of committees for their services and expenses. However, such compensation must be reasonable and comparable to compensation paid by unaffiliated entities for a similar position. Nothing herein shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity, including as an officer, agent, employee, consultant, or otherwise, and receiving reasonable compensation for such service.

##Section 5.13 Indemnity:

The Corporation shall indemnify its directors to the fullest extent allowed by sections 29-406.51 and 29-406.52 of the State of Delaware Official Code, or any corresponding section(s) of any future official State of Delaware code.

##Section 5.14 Standard of Conduct:

In accordance with section 29-406.30 of the State of Delaware Official Code, or any corresponding section(s) of any future official State of Delaware code, a director shall discharge the duties of a director, including duties as a member of any committee on which the director may serve, in good faith, in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation, and with the care a person in a like position would reasonably believe appropriate under similar circumstances. In discharging the duties of a director, a director shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case if prepared or presented by:

(a) One or more officers or employees of the Corporation whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;

(b) Legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert competence and as to which the particular person merits confidence; or

(c) A Board committee which the director is not a member, as to matters within the committee's jurisdiction, if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.

A director is not acting in good faith if he or she has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted in this Section 5.14 unwarranted. A director is not liable to the Corporation, any member, or any other person for any action taken or not taken as a director, if the director acted in compliance with this Section 5.14. The liability of a director for monetary damages to the Corporation and its members shall be eliminated to the fullest extent provided by sections 29-406.51 and 29-406.52 of the State of Delaware Official Code, or any corresponding section(s) of any future official State of Delaware code.

##Section 5.15 Conflict of Interest Transactions:

(a) Conflict of Interest. As used herein this Section 5.15, a "conflict of interest transaction" is a transaction with the Corporation in which a director of the Corporation has a direct or indirect interest. An indirect interest exists where: 
- (i) another entity in which the director has a material interest, or in which the director is a general partner, is a party to the transaction; or 
- (ii) if another entity of which the director is a director, officer, or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the Corporation's Board of Directors.

(b) Approval. A conflict of interest transaction is not always voidable or the basis for imposing liability on the director. The transaction is not voidable or the basis for director liability if it is fair to the corporation at the time it was entered into, or is approved either: (i) in advance by a vote of the Board of Directors, or a Board of Directors committee, and the material facts of the transaction and the director's interest were disclosed or known to the Board or committee; or (ii) if the material facts of the transaction and the director's interest were disclosed or known to the members and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction. Such authorization, approval, or ratification of a conflict of interest transaction can occur as follows:
- (i) By Directors. By the Board of Directors, if the conflict of interest transaction receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the Board or committee who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction. However, a conflict of interest transaction may not be so authorized, approved, or ratified by a single director. If a majority of the directors with no direct or indirect interest in the transaction votes to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking such action. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of the authorization, approval, or ratification, if the transaction is otherwise approved as permitted by law.
- (ii) By Members. By the members of the Corporation if the conflict of interest transaction receives a majority of the votes entitled to be counted. Votes cast by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction may be counted in such a vote to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interest transaction. A majority of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking such action.

##Section 5.16 Resignation and Removal:

(a) Resignation. A director may resign at any time by giving written notice to: (i) the Board of Directors; (ii) the Chairman of the Board; or (iii) the Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation is effective when notice is effective. Notice of resignation is irrevocable once delivered, unless the Board of Directors permits withdrawal prior to its effectiveness.

(b) Removal for Cause. The Board of Directors may remove any director elected by the members for cause at a meeting called for that purpose, if the director has been: (i) declared of unsound mind by a final order of court; (ii) convicted of a felony; or (iii) found by a final order or judgment to have breached any duty arising under these Bylaws, the Articles, or applicable law. Only the Board of Directors may vote to remove such director by a majority vote of the remaining directors.

(c) Removal Without Cause. Any director may be removed without cause at a meeting called for that purpose by the Board of Directors. The director may be removed without cause by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the directors then in office.

##Section 5.17 Advisory Board:

The Board of Directors may, by resolution, establish a board of advisors (the "Advisory Board") to be comprised of one or more individuals chosen by the Board of Directors at its sole discretion. The Board shall not be bound by any of the Advisory Board's advice or decision. Advisory Board members shall not have the rights or privileges of directors or members as set forth in the State of Delaware Official Code, nor the power or authority over operations of the Corporation. An Advisory Board member may be removed at any time by the Board of Directors with or without cause.

An officer also shall inform a superior officer, the Board of Directors, relevant committee thereof, or other appropriate person of:

(a) Any affairs of the Corporation known to the officer, within the officer's scope of functions, that the officer knows to be material;

(b) Any actual or probable material violation of law involving the Corporation; and

(c) Any material breach of duty to the corporation by an officer, employee, or agent that the officer believes has occurred or is likely to occur.

(b) Legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert competence and as to which the particular person merits confidence.

An officer is not acting in good faith if he or she has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted in this Section 6.10 unwarranted. An officer is not liable to the Corporation, any member, or any other person for any action taken or not taken as an officer, if the officer acted in compliance with this Section 6.10.
