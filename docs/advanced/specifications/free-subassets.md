# Eliminate XCP for Subasset Issuances

## Motivation

XCP fees for issuances are principally an *anti-squatting* mechanism (since the BTC fee is sufficient in this case to prevent true SPAM). For subassets, which are namespaced by the parent asset, thereâ€™s no need to limit the number of issuances in any way.

## Design

Fees are calculated in the `issuances.validate()` function.[[1](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterparty-core/blob/master/counterparty-core/counterpartycore/lib/messages/issuance.py#L279)] A protocol change `free_subassets` will be added in the `protocol_changes.json` file. From this block on, the function `issuances.validate()` will return `fee=0` for all subasset issuances.
