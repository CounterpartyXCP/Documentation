# UTXO Support

# Motivations

With UTXO support, it is possible to **attach** / **detach** Counterparty assets directly to / from Bitcoin UTXOs, so that they can be spent just like Colored Coinsâ€“based protocols (such as Ordinals and Runes) using any Bitcoin wallets with support for sat tracking. This featuer enables single-transaction, trustless atomic swaps between BTC and Counterparty assets, as well as Counterparty assets and other L2 protocols. Attaching assets to UTXOs uses the [new gas system](gas-system.md) that allows for a dynamic XCP fee for transactions to reduce the barrier to entry into Counterparty for new users.

# Design

## Attach

1. It is possible to attach an arbitrary number of assets from an address to a UTXO.

1. Assets are attached from transaction source address to the first UTXO non-`OP_RETURN` output or, if provided, to the `destination_vout` output.

1. If `destination_vout` designates an invalid output (`OP_RETURN` or non-existent) or if the transaction contains only a single OP_RETURN output, the transaction is invalid.

1. Fees in XCP, calculated using the [new gas system](gas-system.md), will be paid by the `source` address for an `attach`.

1. For each `attach`, a row will be added to the `send` table, triggering the `ATTACH_TO_UTXO` event.

1. When assets are attached to a UTXO, it is impossible to use them for a Counterparty transaction (`order`, `send`, etc.), apart from `detach`.

1. The embedded data in a `attach` transaction is small enough that an `OP_RETURN` output is always sufficient.


## Detach

1. All inputs of every `detach` transaction are detached.

1. If no `destination` is provided, the assets are sent to the address corresponding to the detached input.

1. It is impossible to perform a `move` at the same time as a `detach`.

1. For each `detach`, a row will be added to the `send` table, triggering the `DETACH_FROM_UTXO` event.

1. The embedded data in a `detach` transaction is small enough that an `OP_RETURN` output is always sufficient.


## Move

1. `utxo.move_assets()` is executed before all Counterparty contracts, except for `attach` transaction.

1. When a UTXO is spent, a row is added to the `send` table for each asset attached to this UTXO, triggering a `UTXO_MOVE` event.


# API

1. API routes

```python
"/v2/addresses/<address>/compose/attach": compose.compose_attach,
"/v2/utxos/<utxo>/compose/detach": compose.compose_detach,
"/v2/utxos/<utxo>/compose/movetoutxo": compose.compose_movetoutxo,
"/v2/compose/attach/estimatexcpfees": compose.get_attach_estimate_xcp_fee,
```

1. To prevent assets from being moved unintentionally, the transaction composition API excludes UTXOs with assets attached by default.

1. Balances contain two fields for UTXO support: `utxo` and `utxo_address`.
