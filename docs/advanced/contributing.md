## Bounties

### The Counterparty Project Bounties
    
The Counterparty Projects offers bounties for various things, but
especially for security issues related to Counterparty software.
You can find more about those bounties here:
[http://counterparty.io/bounties/](http://counterparty.io/bounties/).
     
## Community Bounties
    
From time to time community members create development bounties,
too.

If you want to pay someone to develop a feature or fix a bug for
you:

- Ask in the chat or on the forums. If payment is in crypto, you can try to find a trusted community member to serve as 1-of-3 multisig senders.
- Create a bounty directly under particular issue, or create a bounty on [http://bountysource.com/teams/counterparty/issues](http://bountysource.com/teams/counterparty/issues). Counterparty repos are integrated with Bountysource.
- You can also use other sites and announce your bounties in the chat or on the forums
