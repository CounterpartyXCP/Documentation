title: Broadcast information on the Bitcoin blockchain
---

Counterparty lets you publish text and data on the Bitcoin blockchain, this is called a 'broadcast'. This is useful for proof-of-publication, notary purposes, and creating betting feeds and oracles. This information is timestamped (as blocks), freely browseable and permanently stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. You can view and search broadcasts on a block explorer such as [XChain](https://xchain.io/broadcasts):
