**Disclaimer:** All token information is provided by the creator and/or owner of the individual token and may not be accurate or up to date.

### Showing information about a token you already have

If you would like to learn more about a token you have, click on the down arrow in the token's box and then "Show Info".

### Showing information about any token

If you want to see the information of any token at all even if you are logged out, then you can use a [block explorer](https://xchain.io) to search for the token.

In order to find out whether a token is legitimate, it is a good idea to check the comments section in the block explorer, the token's official website, and social media such as [Bitcointalk](http://bitcointalk.org).
