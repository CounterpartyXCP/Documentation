Import (Sweep) Funds from Other Addresses
---------------------------

Counterwallet can sweep funds from Bitcoin addresses using their private keys. This is especially useful for paper wallets, but can be used for a variety of purposes. 

**Note:** Like any other Counterparty action, this process requires a Bitcoin transaction fee.
