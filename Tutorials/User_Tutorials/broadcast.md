Broadcast information on the Bitcoin blockchain
---------------------------

Counterparty lets you publish text and data on the Bitcoin blockchain, this is called a 'broadcast'. This is useful for proof-of-publication, notary purposes, and creating betting feeds and oracles. This information is timestamped (as blocks), freely browseable and permanently stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. You can view and search broadcasts on a block explorer such as [Blockscan](http://blockscan.com/broadcast?p=0&g=&s=&text=&option=):

**Enter the text or data you want to publish on the BTC blockchain.**

**Note: The fields for fee and value are only used when creating a betting feed, you can leave the default values if you only wish to publish information. "Broadcast Date" (date picker) has no effect (because timestamping is done by bitcoin miners) and may be removed in a future version.**
