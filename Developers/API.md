#Server API

[TOC]


##Overview

The ``counterparty-lib`` server provides a JSON RPC 2.0-based API based off of
that of Bitcoin Core. It is the primary means by which other applications
should interact with the Counterparty network.

For maximum modularity, flexibility and robustness, the API server doesn’t
interact with any Bitcoin wallets itself, even Bitcoin Core's built-in one.
(See the section [Wallet Integration](#Wallet-Integration).)

The API server is started either through the [`CLI interface`](counterparty-cli.md) or with the
[`counterparty-lib`](counterparty_lib.md) Python library.

The API listens on port 4000 by default (14000 for ``testnet``) and requires
HTTP Basic Authentication to connect. It uses JSON RPC 2.0.

Additionally, ``counterparty-lib`` provides a complementary RESTful API also based off of that
of Bitcoin Core. This REST API is still under development and will include more functionality
in the future. The REST API listens on the same port as JSON RPC one.


##Getting Started

By default, the server will listen on port ``4000`` (if on mainnet) or port ``14000`` (on testnet) for API
requests. 

Note that the main API is built on JSON-RPC 2.0, not 1.1. JSON-RPC itself is pretty lightweight, and API requests
are made via a HTTP POST request to ``/api/`` (note the trailing slash), with JSON-encoded data passed as the POST body.

The requests to the secondary REST API are made via HTTP GET to ``/rest/``, with request action and parameters encoded in the URL.


###General Format

####JSON-RPC

All requests must have POST data that is JSON encoded. Here's an example of the POST data for a valid API request:

    {
      "method": "get_sends",
      "params": {"order_by": 'tx_hash',
                 "order_dir": 'asc',
                 "start_block": 280537,
                 "end_block": 280539},
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 0,
    }

The ``jsonrpc`` and ``id`` properties are requirements under the JSON-RPC 2.0 spec.

You should note that the data in ``params`` is a JSON object (e.g. mapping), not an array. In other words, 
**the API only supports named arguments, not positional arguments** (e.g. use
{"argument1": "value1", "argument2": "value2"} instead of ["value1", "value2"]). This is the case for safety and bug-minimization reasons.

For more information on JSON RPC, please see the [JSON RPC 2.0 specification](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).

####REST

For REST API all requests are made via GET where query-specific arguments are encoded as URL parameters. Moreover, the same requests can be
passed via HTTP POST in order to encrypt the transaction parameters. There are only two methods supported: ``get`` and ``compose``. The URL
formats are as follows respectively:
`/rest/<table_name>/get?<filters>&op=<operator>`
`/rest/<message_type>/compose?<transaction arguments>`

###Authentication

The API support HTTP basic authentication to use, which is enabled if and only
if a password is set. **The default user is ``'rpc'``.**


##Example Implementations for JSON RPC API

(Submissions for additional languages are welcome!) 

The following examples have authentication enabled and the `user` set to its
default value of `'rpc'`.

###Python

    import json
    import requests
    from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
    
    url = "http://localhost:4000/api/"
    headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}
    auth = HTTPBasicAuth('rpc', PASSWORD)
    
    payload = {
      "method": "get_running_info",
      "params": {},
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "id": 0,
    }
    response = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload), headers=headers, auth=auth)
    print("Response: ", response.text)


###PHP

With PHP, you use the [JsonRPC](https://github.com/fguillot/JsonRPC)
library.


    <?php
    require 'JsonRPC/src/JsonRPC/Client.php';
    use JsonRPC\Client;
    $client = new Client('http://localhost:4000/api/');
    $client->authentication('rpc', PASSWORD);
    
    $result = $client->execute('get_balances', array('filters' => array('field' => 'address', 'op' => '==', 'value' => '1NFeBp9s5aQ1iZ26uWyiK2AYUXHxs7bFmB')));
    print("get_balances result:\n");
    var_dump($result);
    
    $result2 = $client->execute('get_running_info');
    print("get_running_info result:\n");
    var_dump($result2);
    ?>

###curl

    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/ --user rpc:$PASSWORD -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' -H 'Accept: application/json, text/javascript' --data-binary '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"get_running_info"}'

**NOTE:** On Windows, the command may need to be formatted differently due to problems that Windows has with escapes.

##Example Implementations for REST API

The following examples don't use authentication as with default settings.

###Python

    import requests
    
    url = "http://localhost:4000/rest/"
    headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}

    query = 'sends/get?source=mn6q3dS2EnDUx3bmyWc6D4szJNVGtaR7zc&destination=mtQheFaSfWELRB2MyMBaiWjdDm6ux9Ezns&op=AND'
    
    response = requests.get(url + query, headers=headers)
    print("Response: ", response.text)


###curl

    curl http://127.0.0.1:4000/rest/sends/get?source=mn6q3dS2EnDUx3bmyWc6D4szJNVGtaR7zc&destination=mtQheFaSfWELRB2MyMBaiWjdDm6ux9Ezns&op=AND -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' -H 'Accept: application/json' 

###curl with POST encryption

    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4000/rest/sends/get?source=mn6q3dS2EnDUx3bmyWc6D4szJNVGtaR7zc&destination=mtQheFaSfWELRB2MyMBaiWjdDm6ux9Ezns&op=AND -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' -H 'Accept: application/json'

##Wallet Integration

**Note:** Before v9.49.4, the counterpartyd API provided an interface to Bitcoin Core's signing functionality through the `do_*`, `sign_tx` and `broadcast_tx` methods, which have all since been removed.

The process of making a transaction, from start to finish, depends somewhat on the wallet software used. Below are examples of how one might use a wallet to sign and broadcast an unsigned Counterparty transaction *created* with this API.

**Bitcoin Core with Python**

    def do_send(source, destination, asset, quantity):
            validateaddress = bitcoind_api('validateaddress', [source])
            assert validateaddress['is_mine']
            pubkey = validateaddress['pubkey']
            unsigned_tx = counterpartylib_api('create_send', {'source': source, 'destination': destination, 'asset': asset, 'quantity': quantity, 'pubkey': pubkey})
            signed_tx = bitcoind_api('signrawtransaction', [unsigned_tx])
            tx_hash = bitcoind_api('sendrawtransaction', [signed_tx])
            return tx_hash

**Bitcoin Core with Javascript**

        counterparty_api = function(method, params) {
            // calls Counterparty API method with you prefered method
        }

        bitcoin_api = function(method, params) {
            // calls Bitcoin Core API method with you prefered method
        }

        // generate a passphrase
        var m = new Mnemonic(128); //128 bits of entropy (12 word passphrase)
        var words = m.toWords();
        var passphrase = words.join(' ')

        // generate private key, public key and address from the passphrase
        wallet = new CWHierarchicalKey(passphrase);
        var cwk = wallet.getAddressKey(i); // i the number of the address
        var source = key.getAddress();
        var pubkey = cwk.getPub()

        // generate unsigned transaction
        unsigned_hex = counterparty_api('create_send', {'source': source, 'destination': destination, 'asset': asset, 'quantity': quantity, 'pubkey': pubkey})

        CWBitcore.signRawTransaction2(self.unsignedTx(), cwk, function(signedHex) {
            bitcoin_api('sendrawtransaction', signedHex)
        })
        </script>
    </html>

##Terms & Conventions


###assets

Everywhere in the API an asset is referenced by its name, not its ID. See the
Counterparty protocol specification for what constitutes a valid asset name.
Examples:

- "BTC"
- "XCP"
- "FOOBAR"
- "A7736697071037023001"


###Quantities and balances

Anywhere where an quantity is specified, it is specified in **satoshis** (if a divisible asset), or as whole numbers
(if an indivisible asset). To convert satoshis to floating-point, simply cast to float and divide by 100,000,000.

Examples:

- 4381030000 = 43.8103 (if divisible asset)
- 4381030000 = 4381030000 (if indivisible asset) 

**NOTE:** XCP and BTC themselves are divisible assets.


###floats

Floats are are ratios or floating point values with six decimal places of precision, used in bets and dividends.


##Miscellaneous

###Filtering Read API results

The Counterparty API aims to be as simple and flexible as possible. To this end, it includes a straightforward
way to filter the results of most [Read API](#read-api-function-reference) to get the data you want, and only that.

For each Read API function that supports it, a ``filters`` parameter exists. To apply a filter to a specific data field,
specify an object (e.g. dict in Python) as this parameter, with the following members:

- field: The field to filter on. Must be a valid field in the type of object being returned
- op: The comparison operation to perform. One of: ``"=="``, ``"!="``, ``">"``, ``"<"``, ``">="``, ``"<="``, ``"IN"``, ``"LIKE"``, ``"NOT IN"``, ``"NOT LIKE"``
- value: The value that the field will be compared against. Must be the same data type as the field is
  (e.g. if the field is a string, the value must be a string too)

If you want to filter by multiple fields, then you can specify a list of filter objects. To this end, API functions
that take ``filters`` also take a ``filterop`` parameter, which determines how the filters are combined when multiple
filters are specified. It defaults to ``"and"``, meaning that filters are ANDed togeher (and that any match
must satisfy all of them). You can also specify ``"or"`` as an alternative setting, which would mean that
filters are ORed together, and that any match must satisfy only one of them.

To disable filtering, you can just not specify the filter argument (if using keyword-based arguments), or,
if using positional arguments, just pass ``null`` or ``[]`` (empty list) for the parameter.

For examples of filtering in-use, please see the [examples](#example-implementations).

NOTE: Note that with strings being compared, operators like ``>=`` do a lexigraphic string comparison (which
compares, letter to letter, based on the ASCII ordering for individual characters. For more information on
the specific comparison logic used, please see [this page](http://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html).



###Transaction Encodings

All ``create_`` API calls return an *unsigned raw transaction serialization* as a hex-encoded string (i.e. the same format that ``bitcoind`` returns
with its raw transaction API calls).

The exact form and format of this unsigned raw transaction string is specified via the ``encoding`` and ``pubkey`` parameters on each ``create_``
API call:

- To return the transaction as an **OP_RETURN** transaction, specify ``opreturn`` for the ``encoding`` parameter. **OP_RETURN** transactions cannot have more than 40 bytes of data.
- To return the transaction as a **multisig** transaction, specify ``multisig`` for the ``encoding`` parameter.
    - ``pubkey`` should be set to the hex-encoded public key of the source address.
- To return the transaction as a **pubkeyhash** transaction, specify ``pubkeyhash`` for the ``encoding`` parameter.
    - ``pubkey`` should be set to the hex-encoded public key of the source address.
- ``auto`` may also be specified to let the server choose here. Note that at this time, ``auto`` is effectively the same as
  ``multisig``.


##API Changes

This section documents any changes to the API, for version numbers where there were API-level modifications.

There will be no incompatible API pushes that do not either have: 

* A well known set cut over date in the future 
* Or, a deprecation process where the old API is supported for an amount of time


###9.24.1

**Summary:** New API parsing engine added, as well as dynamic get method composition in ``api.py``: 

* Added ``sql`` API method
* Filter params: Added ``LIKE``, ``NOT LIKE`` and ``IN``



###9.25.0

* new do_* methods: like create_*, but also sign and broadcast the transaction. Same parameters as create_*, plus optional privkey parameter.

**backwards incompatible changes**

* create_*: accept only dict as parameters
* create_bet: ``bet_type`` must be a integer (instead string)
* create_bet: ``wager`` and ``counterwager`` args are replaced by ``wager_quantity`` and ``counterwager_quantity``
* create_issuance: parameter ``lock`` (boolean) removed (use LOCK in description)
* create_issuance: parameter ``transfer_destination`` replaced by ``destination``
* DatabaseError: now a DatabaseError is returned immediately if the database is behind the backend, instead of after fourteen seconds



###9.32.0

**Summary:** API framework overhaul for performance and simplicity 

* "/api" with no trailing slash no longer supported as an API endpoint (use "/" or "/api/" instead)
* We now consistently reject positional arguments with all API methods. Make sure your API calls do not use positional
  arguments (e.g. use {"argument1": "value1", "argument2": "value2"} instead of ["value1", "value2"])



###9.43.0

* create_issuance: ``callable`` is also accepted
* create_*: None is used as default value for missing parameters 

###9.49.3

* \*_issuance: ``callable``, ``call_date`` and ``call_price`` are no longer valid parameters
* \*_callback: removed
* Bitcoin addresses may everywhere be replaced by pubkeys.
* The API will no longer search the local wallet for pubkeys, so they must be passed to the API manually if being used for the first time. Otherwise, you may get a "<address> not published in blockchain" error.

###9.49.4
* The `do_*`, `sign_tx` and `broadcast_tx` methods have been completely deprecated. See the section [Wallet Integration](#Wallet-Integration).
* Added REST API.




#Technical Specification


##Read API Function Reference


###get_{table}

**get_{table}(filters=[], filterop='AND', order_by=None, order_dir=None, start_block=None, end_block=None, status=None,
limit=1000, offset=0, show_expired=True)**

**{table}** must be one of the following values:
``balances``, ``credits``, ``debits``, ``bets``, ``bet_matches``, ``broadcasts``, ``btcpays``, ``burns``, 
``cancels``, ``dividends``, ``issuances``, ``orders``, ``order_matches``, ``sends``,
``bet_expirations``, ``order_expirations``, ``bet_match_expirations``, or ``order_match_expirations``.

For example: ``get_balances``, ``get_credits``, ``get_debits``, etc are all valid API methods.

**Parameters:**

  * **filters (list/dict):** An optional filtering object, or list of filtering objects. See [filtering](#filtering-read-api-results) for more information.
  * **filterop (string):** Specifies how multiple filter settings are combined. Defaults to ``AND``, but ``OR`` can
    be specified as well. See [filtering](#filtering-read-api-results) for more information.
  * **order_by  (string):** If sorted results are desired, specify the name of an attribute of the appropriate table to
    order the results by (e.g. ``quantity`` for [balance object](#balance-object), if you called ``get_balances``).
    If left blank, the list of results will be returned unordered. 
  * **order_dir (string):** The direction of the ordering. Either ``ASC`` for ascending order, or ``DESC`` for descending
    order. Must be set if ``order_by`` is specified. Leave blank if ``order_by`` is not specified.
  * **start_block (integer):** If specified, only results from the specified block index on will be returned 
  * **end_block (integer):** If specified, only results up to and including the specified block index on will be returned
  * **status (string/list):** return only results with the specified status or statuses (if a list of status strings is supplied).
    See the [status list](#status). Note that if ``null`` is supplied (the default), then status is not filtered.
    Also note that status filtering can be done via the ``filters`` parameter, but doing it through this parameter is more
    flexible, as it essentially allows for situations where ``OR`` filter logic is desired, as well as status-based filtering.
  * **limit (integer):** (maximum) number of elements to return. Can specify a value less than or equal to 1000. For more results, use
    a combination of ``limit`` and ``offset`` parameters to paginate results.
  * **offset (integer):** return results starting from specified ``offset``

**Special Parameters:**

  * **show_expired (boolean):** used only for ``get_orders``. When false, get_orders don't return orders which expire next block.

**Return:**

  A list of objects with attributes corresponding to the queried table fields.

**Examples:**

  * To get a listing of bets, call ``get_bets``. This method will return a list of one or more [bet object](#bet-object) .

    ``get_orders`` with the appropriate parameters. This method will return a list of one or more order object](#order-object).

**Notes:**

  * Please note that the ``get_balances`` API call will not return balances for BTC itself. It only returns balances
    for XCP and other Counterparty assets. To get BTC-based balances, use an existing system such as Insight, blockr.io,
    or blockchain.info.
