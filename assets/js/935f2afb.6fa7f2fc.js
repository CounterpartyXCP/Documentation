This system was chosen for its simplicity, but it creates significant friction when onboarding users to the Counterparty ecosystem (esp. since it is so hard to acquire XCP) and yet the fees are so low that they have little economic significance for market participants. A proper XCP fee system should be proportional to network traffic and transaction complexity without creating any unnecessary barriers to entry for users of the network. This protocol change will institute just such a system for the new UTXO Support feature by dynamically calculating the fees required to send assets from an address to a UTXO and from a UTXO to an address based on network congestion for this type of transaction.","sidebar":"advanced"},"advanced/specifications/lockable-issuance-descriptions":{"id":"advanced/specifications/lockable-issuance-descriptions","title":"Be Able to Lock Descriptions","description":"Motivation","sidebar":"advanced"},"advanced/specifications/utxo-support":{"id":"advanced/specifications/utxo-support","title":"UTXO Support","description":"With Ordinals, a user who does not own an Ordinal cannot create a valid Bitcoin transaction to move an Ordinal that is not in their wallet. This is because the user must possess the UTXO that holds the \\"sat\\". Unlike Ordinals, Counterparty as a metaprotcol is entirely detached from Layer-1 consensus rules\u2014this allows Counterparty to be much more versatile and extendable. However, Ordinals, given its large community, offers Counterparty asset owners the opportunity to benefit from greater liquidity and a larger ecosystem generally. For this it is necessary to be able to attach and detach Counterparty assets to/from UTXOs. This will allow Counterparty assets to be compliant with the Ordinals trading transactional structure, allowing the large players in the Ordinals ecosystem to seamlessly integrate with Counterparty assets.","sidebar":"advanced"},"basics/assets/counterparty-assets":{"id":"basics/assets/counterparty-assets","title":"Understanding Assets on Counterparty","description":"With Counterparty, users can create their own assets (also known as \\"tokens\\", \\"coins\\" or \\"currencies\\") inside the Bitcoin blockchain. These are seperate from Bitcoin the currency itself, but exist entirely inside ordinary Bitcoin transactions. Tokens can be received, stored, and sent from any Bitcoin address to any other. They can also be placed in cold storage. Unlike Colored Coins, Counterparty tokens are not tied to the BTC balance of any given address. This means that sending/receiving bitcoins has no effect on the balance of tokens.","sidebar":"basics"},"basics/assets/enhanced-asset":{"id":"basics/assets/enhanced-asset","title":"Enhanced Asset Info","description":"When initially setting or changing your asset\'s (token\'s) description, you can enable enhanced functionality (such as an token image and a longer description) by providing a URL to a specially formatted .json file (e.g. http://www.mydomain.com/foo.json) as the description.
