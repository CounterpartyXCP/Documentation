These are seperate from Bitcoin the currency itself, but exist entirely inside ordinary Bitcoin transactions. Tokens can be received, stored, and sent from any Bitcoin address to any other. They can also be placed in cold storage. Unlike Colored Coins, Counterparty tokens are not tied to the BTC balance of any given address. This means that sending/receiving bitcoins has no effect on the balance of tokens.","sidebar":"basics"},"basics/assets/enhanced-asset":{"id":"basics/assets/enhanced-asset","title":"Enhanced Asset Info","description":"When initially setting or changing your asset\'s (token\'s) description, you can enable enhanced functionality (such as an token image and a longer description) by providing a URL to a specially formatted .json file (e.g. http://www.mydomain.com/foo.json) as the description. This allows the token owner to provide enhanced information to the token\'s holders, and enhances the user experience for these holders for wallet implementations that support this spec.","sidebar":"basics"},"basics/assets/enhanced-feed":{"id":"basics/assets/enhanced-feed","title":"Enhanced Feed Info","description":"Feed providers can initialize a feed via a broadcast where the broadcast text field contains a URL to a specially formatted .json file (e.g. http://www.mydomain.com/foo.json).

It is used for supporting a number of critical Counterparty features which require a protocol-aware currency. Bitcoin can only be aware of BTC, while Counterparty can be aware of both BTC and XCP itself. This makes it possible to escrow funds, trade in a decentralized manner, and harness the full potential of programmable money.","sidebar":"basics"}}}')}}]);
