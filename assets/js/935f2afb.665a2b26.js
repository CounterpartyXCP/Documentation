This system was chosen for its simplicity, but it creates significant friction when onboarding users to the Counterparty ecosystem (esp. since it is so hard to acquire XCP) and yet the fees are so low that they have little economic significance for market participants. A proper XCP fee system should be proportional to network traffic and transaction complexity without creating any unnecessary barriers to entry for users of the network. This protocol change will institute just such a system for the new UTXO Support feature by dynamically calculating the fees required to send assets from an address to a UTXO and from a UTXO to an address based on network congestion for this type of transaction.","sidebar":"advanced"},"advanced/specifications/lockable-issuance-descriptions":{"id":"advanced/specifications/lockable-issuance-descriptions","title":"Be Able to Lock Descriptions","description":"Motivation","sidebar":"advanced"},"advanced/specifications/taproot-envelope":{"id":"advanced/specifications/taproot-envelope","title":"Taproot Envelope","description":"The new taproot encoding allows embedding Counterparty data in transaction witnesses.

This featuer enables single-transaction, trustless atomic swaps between BTC and Counterparty assets, as well as Counterparty assets and other L2 protocols.

These are seperate from Bitcoin the currency itself, but exist entirely inside ordinary Bitcoin transactions. Tokens can be received, stored, and sent from any Bitcoin address to any other. They can also be placed in cold storage. Unlike Colored Coins, Counterparty tokens are not tied to the BTC balance of any given address. This means that sending/receiving bitcoins has no effect on the balance of tokens.","sidebar":"basics"},"basics/assets/enhanced-asset":{"id":"basics/assets/enhanced-asset","title":"Enhanced Asset Info","description":"When initially setting or changing your asset\'s (token\'s) description, you can enable enhanced functionality (such as an token image and a longer description) by providing a URL to a specially formatted .json file (e.g. http://www.mydomain.com/foo.json) as the description.
