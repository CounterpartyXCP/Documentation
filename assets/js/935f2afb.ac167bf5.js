This means that sending/receiving bitcoins has no effect on the balance of tokens.","sidebar":"basics"},"basics/assets/enhanced-asset":{"id":"basics/assets/enhanced-asset","title":"Enhanced Asset Info","description":"When initially setting or changing your asset\'s (token\'s) description, you can enable enhanced functionality (such as an token image and a longer description) by providing a URL to a specially formatted .json file (e.g. http://www.mydomain.com/foo.json) as the description.
