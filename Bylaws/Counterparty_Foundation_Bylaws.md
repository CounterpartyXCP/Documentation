Within one week before voting period begins:
- Community Director candidate nominated. May self nominate, or be nominated by another individual.

The sitting board of directors, by a super-majority vote, may disqualify non-viable candidates from election.
- At the start of the two week voting period: 
    - Current Executive Director (or other Executive Committee member of the Executive Director’s choosing) will generate a Bitcoin address for each Community Director candidate.
    - Current Executive Director (or other Executive Committee member of the Executive Director’s choosing) will issue a specific vote token of a specific quantity of 10 million units, divisible, and locked. (Quantity may be changed by a majority vote of directors.)
    - Current Executive Director (or other executive committee member of the Executive Director’s choosing) will issue a dividend to XCP holders with this vote token as the dividend asset. (Meaning that all XCP addresses will receive some quantity vote token in proportion to their XCP balance.)
- During this two week voting period:

However, the director shall provide prior notice to the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman approves the request. Such a request shall not be unreasonably denied. An observer attending in place of a director shall have the right to fully participate in the general session, but may not vote on or put forth any motion.

Each director shall hold office until his or her successor is elected. A vacancy shall be deemed to exist in the following situations:

(b) An increase in the authorized number of directors without election of the additional directors so provided for;

(c) Failure to elect the full number of authorized directors;

##Section 5.9 Action Without Meeting:

(c) Are included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken.

A director participating in a meeting by this means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.

##Section 5.11 Quorum:

Unless otherwise provided herein, fifty-percent (50%) of the directors then in office (but in no case fewer than one-third (1/3) of the fixed or prescribed number of directors provided for in these Bylaws) shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, except to adjourn.

##Section 5.13 Indemnity:

The Corporation shall indemnify its directors to the fullest extent allowed by sections 29-406.51 and 29-406.52 of the State of Delaware Official Code, or any corresponding section(s) of any future official State of Delaware code.

##Section 5.14 Standard of Conduct:

In accordance with section 29-406.30 of the State of Delaware Official Code, or any corresponding section(s) of any future official State of Delaware code, a director shall discharge the duties of a director, including duties as a member of any committee on which the director may serve, in good faith, in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Corporation, and with the care a person in a like position would reasonably believe appropriate under similar circumstances. In discharging the duties of a director, a director shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case if prepared or presented by:

(a) One or more officers or employees of the Corporation whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;

(b) Legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert competence and as to which the particular person merits confidence; or

(c) A Board committee which the director is not a member, as to matters within the committee's jurisdiction, if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.

A director is not acting in good faith if he or she has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted in this Section 5.14 unwarranted. A director is not liable to the Corporation, any member, or any other person for any action taken or not taken as a director, if the director acted in compliance with this Section 5.14. The liability of a director for monetary damages to the Corporation and its members shall be eliminated to the fullest extent provided by sections 29-406.51 and 29-406.52 of the State of Delaware Official Code, or any corresponding section(s) of any future official State of Delaware code.

##Section 5.15 Conflict of Interest Transactions:

(a) Conflict of Interest. As used herein this Section 5.15, a "conflict of interest transaction" is a transaction with the Corporation in which a director of the Corporation has a direct or indirect interest. An indirect interest exists where: 
- (i) another entity in which the director has a material interest, or in which the director is a general partner, is a party to the transaction; or 
- (ii) if another entity of which the director is a director, officer, or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the Corporation's Board of Directors.

(b) Approval. A conflict of interest transaction is not always voidable or the basis for imposing liability on the director. The transaction is not voidable or the basis for director liability if it is fair to the corporation at the time it was entered into, or is approved either: (i) in advance by a vote of the Board of Directors, or a Board of Directors committee, and the material facts of the transaction and the director's interest were disclosed or known to the Board or committee; or (ii) if the material facts of the transaction and the director's interest were disclosed or known to the members and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction. Such authorization, approval, or ratification of a conflict of interest transaction can occur as follows:
- (i) By Directors. By the Board of Directors, if the conflict of interest transaction receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the Board or committee who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction. However, a conflict of interest transaction may not be so authorized, approved, or ratified by a single director. If a majority of the directors with no direct or indirect interest in the transaction votes to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking such action. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of the authorization, approval, or ratification, if the transaction is otherwise approved as permitted by law.
- (ii) By Members. By the members of the Corporation if the conflict of interest transaction receives a majority of the votes entitled to be counted. Votes cast by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction may be counted in such a vote to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interest transaction. A majority of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking such action.

##Section 5.16 Resignation and Removal:

(a) Resignation. A director may resign at any time by giving written notice to: (i) the Board of Directors; (ii) the Chairman of the Board; or (iii) the Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation is effective when notice is effective. Notice of resignation is irrevocable once delivered, unless the Board of Directors permits withdrawal prior to its effectiveness.

(b) Removal for Cause. The Board of Directors may remove any director elected by the members for cause at a meeting called for that purpose, if the director has been: (i) declared of unsound mind by a final order of court; (ii) convicted of a felony; or (iii) found by a final order or judgment to have breached any duty arising under these Bylaws, the Articles, or applicable law. Only the Board of Directors may vote to remove such director by a majority vote of the remaining directors.

(c) Removal Without Cause. Any director may be removed without cause at a meeting called for that purpose by the Board of Directors. The director may be removed without cause by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the directors then in office.

##Section 5.17 Advisory Board:

The Board of Directors may, by resolution, establish a board of advisors (the "Advisory Board") to be comprised of one or more individuals chosen by the Board of Directors at its sole discretion. The Board shall not be bound by any of the Advisory Board's advice or decision. Advisory Board members shall not have the rights or privileges of directors or members as set forth in the State of Delaware Official Code, nor the power or authority over operations of the Corporation.
