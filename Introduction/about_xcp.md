What is XCP?
=====================

XCP is the native token of Counterparty. 

#### How was XCP launched?

The supply of XCP was created in a process called 'proof-of-burn' that started January 2nd and ended February 3rd of 2014 (a total of 5000 Bitcoin blocks). During this period, anyone was able to exchange bitcoins for XCP automatically under the following terms.

* The number of XCP received per BTC is between 1000 and 1500, with more being rewarded the earlier the burn took place.
* The reward bonus decreased linearily with the block index.
* No more than 1 BTC may be burned by any address.
