What is XCP?
=====================

XCP is the native token of Counterparty. Creating XCP was a technical necessity for adding advanced features to Counterparty, which by nature require a protocol aware currency. It is a common misconception that XCP is a competitor to Bitcoin, when in fact it cannot exist without it. **Even though XCP is not a traditional currency, it serves a steady and critical purpose within the Counterparty ecosystem.**

### How was XCP launched?

The supply of XCP was created in a process called 'proof-of-burn' that started January 2nd and ended February 3rd of 2014 (a total of 5000 Bitcoin blocks). 

**During this period, anyone was able to exchange bitcoins for XCP automatically on a protocol level under the following conditions:**

* Users sent their BTC to a verifiably unspendable Bitcoin address with no known private key. ([1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr](http://blockscan.com/burn))

* Each BTC was automatically exchanged for a number of XCP between 1000 and 1500, with more being rewarded the earlier the burn took place.

* The reward bonus decreased linearily with the block index.

* Each address was limited to 1 BTC.

Since the BTC on the burn address will never be spendable again, they are considered destroyed or 'burned'.
 
### Smart contracts execution steps (gas) are paid in XCP.

Every computational step of a smart contract (decentralized application) requires a fee to be paid in XCP. This fee is referred to as gas and is, aptly enough, burned. What this means, is that the XCP spent on these fees is destroyed and taken out of circulation permanently. By using fractions of the total supply instead of fixed costs, a depletion of the XCP supply through fees can be avoided indefinitely.

**When evaluating XCP, there are other several facts to keep in mind:**

* XCP cannot be seen as a competitor of Bitcoin, since it cannot conceivably exist without it.
* It is not intended to be used as a purchasing currency, although there is nothing to prevent this.
