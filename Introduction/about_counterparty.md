What is Counterparty?
=====================

**Counterparty is a peer-to-peer financial platform and a distributed, open-source Internet protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and network.**

By encoding data in ordinary Bitcoin transactions, Counterparty extends Bitcoin’s functionality in new and unprecedented ways, opening the door for innovation. The Bitcoin protocol stays exactly the same, while enabling the development and adoption of valuable new features, all secured by the full power of the Bitcoin network. 

Besides providing users with the world’s first functioning decentralized exchange, as well as the ability to create virtual assets, issue dividends, create price feeds and bets, Counterparty enables anyone to create smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. Smart contracts are agreements whose terms and conditions are digitized, and do not require arbitration by a third-party to determine their outcome, but instead are executed automatically, with no intermediation. Counterparty's built-in Turing-complete scripting language allows anyone to create custom smart contracts and execute their code on the Bitcoin blockchain.

**The Counterparty platform consists of several components:**

* [counterparty-lib][] is the reference implementation of the Counterparty Protocol.

* [counterparty-cli][] is a command line interface for counterparty-lib.

* [counterparty-gui][] is a modular graphical interface for counterparty-lib.

* `XCP` is the native token of the platform. It exists as a technical necessity for most advanced Counterparty features. It is **not** a competitor of Bitcoin, and in fact cannot exist without it. It acts as fuel for smart contracts, wherein execution steps are paid by destroying XCP as fees. 

* [Counterwallet][], a secure web wallet with client-side logins and transaction signing. A hosted version is available on [Counterwallet.io](http://counterwallet.io)

**With Counterparty, users can:**

* Send assets (also known as tokens, coins, derivatives, or shares depending on the context) from any Bitcoin address to another
* Create assets (numeric or alphabetical)
* Issue additional units of their own assets (or lock them to prevent this)
* Pay distributions on assets using BTC, XCP, or other assets (e.g. dividends)
* Trade XCP and assets on Counterparty's distributed exchange
* Broadcast textual and numeric data onto the Bitcoin blockchain
* Make bets and derivatives on broadcasted data
* Provably distribute ownership of assets through multi-signature support.
* Take advantage of turing-complete scripting to craft smart contracts and financial instruments.
