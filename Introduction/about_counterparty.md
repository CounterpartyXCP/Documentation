What is Counterparty?
=====================

**Counterparty is a peer-to-peer financial platform and a distributed, open-source protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain and network. By encoding data and interacting with ordinary Bitcoin transactions, Counterparty expands the uses and features of Bitcoin in new and unprecedented ways.**

Pioneering in its field, the true innovation of [Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) makes peer-to-peer transfer of value available to anyone with an internet connection. But as many nascent technologies before it, Bitcoin only offers the technical foundation necessary to reach its full potential. This becomes especially obvious when one considers that even the Internet had to evolve past simply transferring plaintext to break through into the mainstream. The time has arrived to take Bitcoin another step towards truly programmable money.

To address this, Counterparty was developed as an application layer secured by the full power of the Bitcoin network, while the underlying Bitcoin protocol itself stays exactly the same. Therefore, many compare Counterparty to the 'Hypertext Transfer Protocol' ([HTTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)), which exists as a layer on [TCP/IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite), and provides the foundation of the internet as we know it today. 

The Counterparty protocol (and its internal token XCP) was launched in January 2014 without raising any funds. Its first introduction to the world was a release of working source code. This was in full accordance with the core Counterparty philosophy, or in the words of Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, "We can try to use words to help the situation until code gets there." To learn more about the internal token of Counterparty, [read about XCP](about_xcp.md).

**In summary, Counterparty is:**

* a feature-complete toolkit for developing decentralized applications and financial instruments

* a smart contracts environment that is 100% cross-compatible with Ethereum

* a system for issuing and trading tokens and currencies without counterparty risk

* a decentralized exchange with algorithmic order matching and trustless escrow

* a method for proof-of-publication and proof-of-ownership with the security of the Bitcoin blockchain 

* _Entirely free, modular and extensible open-source software_

**The Counterparty platform consists of several components:**

* [counterparty-lib][] is the reference implementation of the Counterparty Protocol.

* [counterparty-cli][] is a command line interface for counterparty-lib.

* [counterparty-gui][] is a modular graphical interface for counterparty-lib.

* [Counterwallet][] is a secure web wallet with client-side logins and transaction signing. A hosted version is available [here](http://counterwallet.io).

* **[XCP](about_xcp.md)** is the native, deflationary token of the platform. It is a technical necessity, and forms a symbiosis with bitcoin. It is not designed to be a traditional currency per se, although it can be used as such if desired.

Counterparty has successfully ported Ethereum's smart contracts system onto the Bitcoin blockchain, pioneering the most feature complete solution for developing decentralized applications on the Bitcoin blockchain. Smart contracts are agreements (or applications) whose terms and conditions are upheld by the protocol itself, and do not require arbitration by a third-party to determine their outcome. These agreements are secured by the blockchain, and execute automatically without intermediation or any counterparty risk. 

Creating custom contracts and DApps on the Bitcoin blockchain is now possible using the same languages as Ethereum DApps, and the virtual machines are entirely cross-compatible. The smart contracts system is Turing-complete, offering limitless potential for building custom financial instruments, intelligent markets, organizations, games, and countless other creative uses.
